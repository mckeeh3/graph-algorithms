# graph-algorithms
## Implementations of various graph algorithms

The code is written using an expressive approach where there are less ambiguous types. 
For example, see the Node and Nodes class. The more expressive classes are used instead of more
ambiguous data structures, such as arrays of strings. Also using short - do one thing - methods.
The goal is to make the code more readable and maintainable.
