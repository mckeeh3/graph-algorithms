# graph-algorithms
## Implementations of various graph algorithms

The code is written using an expressive approach where there are less ambiguous types. 
For example, see the Node and Nodes classes. The more expressive classes are used instead of more
ambiguous data structures, such as arrays of strings. Also using short - do one thing - methods.
The goal is to make the code more readable and maintainable. Once the code is working then do
any required optimizations that may require using more ambiguous data structures.
